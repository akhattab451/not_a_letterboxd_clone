# not_a_letterboxd_clone

This is a Flutter clone of the Letterboxd app, but it doesn't look quite like it. I'm using the TMDB API since the Letterboxd API is still private. I won't be implementing authentication, this is just what the app looks like to a guest or a logged out user.

## Screens implemented:

## Screens to implement:

    - Tabs Page
    - Films
    - Reviews
    - Lists
    - News (Dummy Page since TMDB doesn't feature a news endpoint)
    - Drawer (Dummy options)

## Screens that I'm most likely won't be implementing but who knows:

    - Movie Page
    - Search Page
    - All auth related pages
    - All user related pages
