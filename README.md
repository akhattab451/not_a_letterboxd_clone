# not_a_letterboxd_clone

This is a Flutter clone of the Letterboxd app, but it doesn't look quite like it. I'm making it for educational purposes. I'm using the TMDB API for film data, since the Letterboxd API is still private. I won't be implementing authentication, this is just what the app looks like to a guest or a logged out user.

### Screens implemented:

- Tabs page
- Drawer

### Screens to implement:

- Films page
- Reviews page
- Lists page
- News page

### Screens that I most likely won't be implementing but who knows:

- Film page
- Cast and Crew pages
- Search page
- All auth related pages
- All user related pages
