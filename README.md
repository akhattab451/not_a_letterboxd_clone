# not_a_letterboxd_clone

This is a Flutter clone of the Letterboxd app, but it doesn't look quite like it. I'm using the TMDB API for film data, since the Letterboxd API is still private. I won't be implementing authentication, this is just what the app looks like to a guest or a logged out user.

### Screens implemented:

    - Tabs page
    - Drawer (Dummy options)

### Screens to implement:

    - Films page
    - Reviews page
    - Lists page
    - News page (Dummy Page since the TMDB API doesn't feature a news endpoint)

### Screens that I most likely won't be implementing but who knows:

    - Film page
    - Cast and Crew pages
    - Search page
    - All auth related pages
    - All user related pages
